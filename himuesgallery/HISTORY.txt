Version 1.1
-----------
- If the Drupal-Installation is in a subdir, not in DOCMUNET_ROOT, you are unable to create a gallery -> fixed (thanks to Hanno and HighD)
- You can't select css-entry "--- himuesgallery.css in PictureDir ---" -> fixed

Version 1.4
-----------
- Now you can use subdirs (up to depth 2) -> thanks to tonino66

Version 1.5
-----------
- if your gallery-path in "Administer->Himues Gallery" begins with /, no thumbs and pictures will be shown -> fixed (thanks to Mark)

Version 1.6
-----------
- starting development of the drupal 7 port of the modul
- eliminate the usage of SERVER_ROOT and use DRUPAL_ROOT instead (commendation of MA-Hugh #875704)
- preview should work like Gilneas suggested in #906900
- include replacement tags for german umlaute (thanks to h.paul for the hint #995570)
- poor image quality - don't using function "imageinterlace" anymore (thanks to gvdvenis #995556)

Version 1.7
-----------
- I've made a mistake with cvs-system. Therefore Version 1.6 includes the Drupal 6 files. In Version 1.7 are the correct files now.

Version 1.8
-----------
- If you go to admin/himuesgallery you get an error about missing variable $pathes -> corrected. Not a critical bug, only path after
  "The base directory of the gallerys for this site relativ to" would not be shown
- same under the "Gallery Path Select"-dropdownbox in add/edit-form
- himuesgallery don't work if drupal is not in webserver root #1038492 thanks to brodiebrodie

Version 1.9
-----------
- Unfortunately Lightbox2 is not available for Drupal 7 now. There is a beta, but that dosn't work for me.
  Due to a hint from brodiebrodie i get knowledge of the module Colorbox. Because it is relativly simply to implement is decide to do it ;-)
  If Colorbox is enabled, himuesgallery will use it automatically.
  I decide to implement the neccessary JavaScript-code in himuesgallery.tpl.php.
  If you want to theme a module, this is the file in wich you do it. If you want to set other parameters for colorbox, then you can do it
  in the same place.

Version 1.10
------------
- git test

Version 1.11
------------
Fixes
- #1093988 - replace deprecated PHP-function "split" by "preg_split". Thanks to Darom.
- #1060454 - after renewing thumbnails the cahces will be cleared to avoid the problem that no thumbnails will be shown. Thanks to kkobus, rggoode, dasmaeh, RogueM, charles.thompson.
- #1060454 - if Webserver runs on a windows machine thumbnails would not be shown because windows uses "\" as path separator. Thanks to goldramgb .
- Modul-Install don't set persistant variable "himuesgallery_admin_settigs" and modul-uninstall don't delete it.

News
- Now it is possible to put HTML-links in description.
  You have to create a text-file that has the same name as the picture but ".inc" as extension. In description you put the tag ".link." where the link should be shown. 
  ".inc" has following format:
       line 1: Text that should be shown in description
       line 2: link-adress
       line 3: link destination (_blank, _self, _parent, _top)
       
  e.g. filename of picture  is 001-Link .link. to somewhere.jpg
       filename of linkfile is 001-Link .link. to somewhere.inc
       
       .inc-file has following content:
       me
       http://drupal.org
       _blank
       
       Result is the Description: Link me to somewhere
       where "me" is a link to http://drupal.org

- new Option "Respect aspect ratio for thumbnails"
  Until now thumbnails where created the following way:
   -> if a picture is higher than width the thumbnail gets the thumbnail_height that is defined in the css-file. thumbnail_width is calculated in consideration of the aspect ratio
   -> if a picture is wider than high thumbnail gets thumbnail_height and thumbnail_width as defined in the css-file. so all "width-pictures" have the same size.
   
  If you use the new option "Respect aspect ratio for thumbnails" and set it to "Yes", thumbnails will be created with aspect ratio. So the pictures could have different sizes
  but no more than defined with thumbnail_height and thumbnail_width in the css-file.

Version 1.12
