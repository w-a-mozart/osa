A repository to manage custom modules for drupal and civicrm.

This work is being done to support a non-profit children's music association.

All of this code is now in use.
One day, we'll get around to submitting to the appropriate project (this development is being done on a totally volunteer basis in the wee hours of the night).

Some of the things included are:

civicrm to drupal commerce integration
- a civicrm custom payment processor which adds membership registration, event registration, other generic contributions to a drupal commerce cart rather than an actual payment processor directly.

drupal to QuickBooks integration
- a drupal module that uses the Drupal 7 Queue, the PHP DevKit from ConsoliBYTE and the Intuit QuickBooks Web Connector utility. This allows us to post a combination of Drupal Commerce orders and CiviCRM contribution records into a desktop version of QuickBooks.

paid civicrm relationships
- extend civicrm to enable end users to create and pay for a time limited relationship with another contact. Our use-case is to allow students to register and pay for private lesson fees with a specific teacher.

drupal commerce payment processor for Elavon
- Elavon (https://www.myvirtualmerchant.com/) payment processor for drupal commerce using some of the code from the CiviCRM Elavon payment processor.

Search by Page for CiviCRM Events
- standard Drupal search doesn't search the CiviCRM Events descriptions. This module enables the full text indexing of CiviCRM Events by the drupal Search by Page module.

Very simple media gallery
- the himuesgallery module provides a simple images gallery module. We wanted to add a simple way to add links to youtube videos along with the photos and have them appear in a Colorbox. Note that this is a copy of the himuesgallery module (7.x-1.12) with our code. A patch has been submitted at http://drupal.org/node/1595716.
