A repository to manage custom modules for drupal and civicrm.

This work is being done to support a non-profit children's music association.
It is very much a work in progress.

Some of the things we are attempting are:

civicrm to drupal commerce integration
- a civicrm custom payment processor which adds membership registration, event registration, other generic contributions to a drupal commerce cart rather than an actual payment processor directly.

paid civicrm relationships
- extend civicrm to enable end users to create and pay for a time limited relationship with another contact. Our use-case is to allow students to register and pay for private lesson fees with a specific teacher.
